   NAICS codes
      :term:`NAICS codes` are used to categorize all industries on a variety of levels of specificity.
      Our modules use them to initialize :term:`NAICS trees<NAICS tree>`.
      We choose to use :term:`NAICS codes` as our standard because they "are the standard used by Federal statistical agencies in classifying business establishments" (`North American Industry Classification System <http://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/>`_), and nearly all our data sources are Federal statistical agencies.
